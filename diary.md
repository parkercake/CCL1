13th Jan - I planned what I should do on which day and started to code.


14th Jan - I did not start with the template, however I used the template as a guide. I started with implementing some of the BaseGameObject class methods.


15th Jan - Continued with BaseGameObject class and started to get the gameLoop working.


16th Jan - Realised that I am slow and started using the template. Worked on solving runtime/deltatime issues.


17th Jan - Worked on level layout (map.js) and startscreen implementation & collectables


20th Jan - Done with Start Screen & collectables, started with End screen, which means implementing losing/winning conditions. Decided later that I should start drawing and so I did (character). Solved runtime/deltatime issues


21st Jan - Losing condition done. Winning condition had minor problems (struggled with implementing finishline). A lot of drawing (background).


22nd Jan - Still drawing (background & enemy). Tried to fix "collision on block causing character to teleport on top of block 'problem'".


23rd Jan - Talked to tutor about the "problem", said that it takes way too much time because the gravity function would have to be changed completely. The finish line has been implemented, finalised. Worked on presentation.


24th Jan - Presentation day!!
